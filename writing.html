      <h2>Writing & Insights</h2>
      <p>
        I read a lot about how the CS job market has changed: fewer entry-level positions,
        more competition, AI tools everywhere, and companies optimizing for cost and risk.
        Instead of ignoring that reality, I try to think clearly about it and adjust my
        strategy as a student and early-career engineer.

      <h2>Breaking into CS in a Crowded Market</h2>
      <p>
        A few themes keep coming up when I look at discussions from hiring managers,
        senior engineers, and people who have recently broken in:
      </p>
      <ul class="focus-list">
        <li><strong>Real projects beat generic certificates.</strong> It’s much more convincing to show a working app, lab, or tool than a list of course names.</li>
        <li><strong>Domain focus is valuable.</strong> Knowing something specific (security, data workflows, backend APIs) helps you stand out compared to being “just another CS student.”</li>
        <li><strong>Impact matters.</strong> Numbers like “17k+ job postings analyzed” or “60% reduction in manual work” are much easier to understand than “I used Python.”</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency over hype.</strong> Long-term effort on a few good projects says more than jumping from trend to trend without depth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My portfolio reflects this by focusing on fewer, deeper projects (FinTrack, AI JobShield,
        networked servers, and a security lab) rather than a long list of half-finished experiments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section reveal-on-scroll">
      <h2>How This Shapes My Choices</h2>
      <ul class="focus-list">
        <li><strong>Projects with clear users or workflows:</strong> personal finance, job seekers, SOC analysts.</li>
        <li><strong>Stack choices that show fundamentals:</strong> React, Django, SQL, Java networking, Python ML.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence of impact:</strong> automation that saves time, models trained on real datasets, and systems that run reliably.</li>
        <li><strong>Honesty about where I’m still learning:</strong> security lab is a work in progress, and part of its value is documenting that journey.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over time, I plan to turn these notes into more polished essays and short guides.
        For now, this page is a snapshot of how I think about career strategy as a
        Computer Science student approaching graduation and OPT.

      <h2>Let’s Talk</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy hearing from teams that think carefully about how they build products and
        support early-career engineers. If this page resonated, feel free to reach out.
